                            <h2>Company Information</h2>
                            <p>TWT is an independently family-owned transportation business. We have been in the transportation 
                                business since the early 50's, when Charles Monin hauled his first load of bulk milk. Through 
                                hard work and dedication, we have grown from a single truck operation to over 50 trucks. Today, 
                                our fleet consists of 65-70 tractors, over 300 trailers, 35 are refrigerated units. It was never 
                                our goal to become a big trucking company but to provide excellent service based on the needs of 
                                our customers, we grew. Being from the bourbon capital of the world, our primary focus has become 
                                the bourbon industry.  We have had the pleasure of working within the automotive industry, as well 
                                as working with some of the largest distribution centers in the U.S..  Our sister company, 
                                Bardstown Warehousing, offers solutions for your warehousing and distribution needs.</p>
